You have heard...

> "If you can read, you can learn anything."

> "Reading is the key that opens doors."

> "Reading is power."

But what do you need to know in order to read?

- "C" sounds like
- "A" sounds like
- "T" sounds like

Letter sound translation

Obvious

What about meaning?

The cat is on the mat.

The _feline_ is on the mat?

You need vocabulary

Obvious

But

You need to know more than vocabulary to read with understanding

You need knowledge of the world.

Why?

## Reason #1 Bridging Gaps

- People leave out information when they write
- They expect that your knowledge will fill in the blanks

Try this

> "I didn't even order that book, but the postman left it on my porch in the
> rain so now I guess I'm stuck with it."

1. Idea: Don't want the wet book
2. Idea: I must keep the book

What's the connection?

Your knowledge goes here

1. Idea: Don't want the wet book
   - Books are ruined when wet
   - Stores do not allow reteurn of ruined merchandise
2. Idea: I must keep the book

YOU bring the knowledge to connect these ideas...

Try another

> "This brain scan is fuzzy, so I think the patient was wearing makeup."

Say what?

1. Idea: The brain scan is fuzzy
   - Brain scans use magnets, so metal makes images fuzzy
   - Makeup contains trace amounts of metal
2. Idea: The patient wore makeup

Without your knowledge, these two ideas don't connect

## Reason #2 Resolving ambiguity

Much of what we read would be ambiguous if we didn't have prior knowledge

Try this

> The procedure is actually quite simple. First you arrange items into different
> groups. Of course one pile may be sufficient depending on how much there is to
> do. If you have to go somewhere else due to lack of facilities that is the
> next step; otherwise, you are pretty well set. It is important not to overdo
> things. That is, it is better to do too few things at once than too many.

Say what?

Why is this tricky?

- You know the vocabulary
- Each sentence is easy to understand

That paragraph was about washing clothes

Now that you know that, try again.

> The procedure is actually quite simple. First you arrange items into different
> groups. Of course one pile may be sufficient depending on how much there is to
> do. If you have to go somewhere else due to lack of facilities that is the
> next step; otherwise, you are pretty well set. It is important not to overdo
> things. That is, it is better to do too few things at once than too many.

Your **knowledge** about laundry makes the ambiguous sentences comprehensible.

Without that knowledge, you'd **never** understand, even though you know the
vocabulary.

Usually it's not a block of text that's ambiguous, it's a sentence or phrase.

> The hunter said "There's a grouse across that field, maybe 100 yards away."
> His friend said **"Well, shoot."**

This sentence DOES NOT MEAN "Fire your gun."

Background knowledge:

- Shotguns aren't accurate at 100 yards
- A grouse that has flown from cover is _gone_

"Well, shoot" mean "Too bad. We missed it."

## Knowledge matters to reading

Some data:

An experiment of jr. high school students:

- 1/2 are "good readers", and
- 1/2 are "poor readers" according to a standard reading test

In each group:

- 1/2 know a lot about baseball
- 1/2 know only a little

The students read a story describing a baseball game. Periodically they must
stop and show on a game board what has happened.

So who understood the story? The kids the reading test said were "good readers"
or the kids who knew a lot about baseball?

- "Good readers" who didn't know baseball got 18.8 items correct out of 40
  possible (47%)
- "Poor readers" who knew baseball got 27.5 items correct out of 40 possible
  (69%)

**Knowing the subject makes you a "good reader"!**

This effect has been observed with knowledge other than baseball, for example:

- the circulatory system
- photocopy technology
- the Vietnam War

So who are "good readers"?

- People who know a bit of everything, so they know something about whatever
  comes up on a reading test!
- General cultural knowledge correlates about 0.50 with reading comprehension
  test scores

\0.50 correlation?

That's about the correlation between parents' heights and their children's
heights.

- That's a big correlation!

So how is a student supposed to learn all this knowledge?

Pop Quiz:

What percentage of class time goes to Social Studies in US first-grade
classrooms?

1. 2%
2. 8%
3. 12%
4. 17%

Answer: 2%

What percentage of class time goes to Science in US first-grade classrooms?

1. 4%
2. 8%
3. 12%
4. 17%

Answer: 4%

That's first grade; third grade is not much different:

- Social Studies: about 5%
- Science: about 5%

What percentage of time goes to Language Arts?

- First grade: 62%
- Third grade: 47%

Where does all that time go? Too much goes to reading strategies like:

- Find the main idea
- Activate prior knowledge
- Identify the author's purpose

Experiments show:

1. Reading stategies do help...
2. But it's a one-time boost. Practicing reading strategies doesn't help!
3. There's no point in spending more than 10 lessons on them, tops

> England's openers labored 34 balls before scoring their first boundary as
> Strauss cracked two fours through the leg side. Cook make a patient start
> before motoring past his skipper.

If you don't have prior knowledge of cricket, no strategy is going to help you.

## Summary

1. Once studnets learn decoding they can decode anything.
2. But they can't **understand** anything they read. Comprehension requires
   **prior knowledge**.
3. Attempts to boost comprehension through reading strategies alone will fail.

_Use reading materials that teach something about the world!_

_Don't neglect other subjects!_

Teaching science is teaching reading

Teaching history is teaching reading

Teaching geography is teaching reading

Teaching music is teaching reading

Teaching art is teaching reading

Teaching civics is teaching reading

Teaching civics is teaching reading

Teaching **content** is teaching reading
