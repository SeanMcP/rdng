## Phonological and phonemic awareness

### What is it?

> Definition

_Phonological awareness_ is a broad skill that includes identifying and
manipulating larger units of oral language -- parts such as words, syllables,
onsets and rimes and individual sounds (phonemes). _Phonemic awareness_ refers
to the ability to focus on and manipulate individual sounds (phonemes) in spoken
words. Acquiring phonemic awareness is important because it is the foundation
for spelling and word recognition skills. Phonemic awareness is one of the best
predictors of how well children will learn to read during the first two years of
instruction.

### A kid's perspective

> What this feels like to me

Children will usually express their frustration and reading difficulties in a
general way, with statements like "I hate reading!". But if they could, this is
how kids might express their difficulties with phonological and/or phonemic
awareness:

- I don't know any words that rhyme with _cat_.
- What do you mean thw you say what sounds are in the word _brush_?
- I'm not sure how many syllables are in my name.
- I don't know what sounds are the same in _bit_ and _hit_.

### A parent's perspective

> What this looks like at home

Here are some clues that a child may be having problems with phonological or
phonemic awareness:

- She has difficulty thinking of rhyming words for a simple word like _cat_
  (such as _rat_ or _bat_).
- He doesn't show interest in language play, word games, or rhyming.

### A teacher's perspective

> What this looks like at school

Here are some clues that a student may have problems with phonological or
phonemic awareness:

- She doesn't correctly complete blending activities; for example, put together
  sounds /k/ /i/ /ck/ to make the word _kick_.
- He doesn't correctly complete phoneme substitution activities; for example ,
  change the /m/ in _mate_ to /cr/ in order to make _crate_.
- She has a hard time telling how many syllables there are in the word _paper_.
- He has difficulty with rhyming, syllabication, or spelling a new word by its
  sound.

## Word decoding and phonics

> Definition

### What is it?

_Decoding_ is the ability to apply your knowledge of letter-sound relationships,
including knowledge of letter patterns, to correctly pronounce written words.
Understanding these relationships gives children the ability to recognize
familiar words quickly and to figure out word they haven't seen before. Although
children may sometimes figure out some of these relationships on their own, most
children benefit from explicit instruction in this area. _Phonics_ is one
approach to reading instruction that teaches students the principles of
letter-sound relationships, how to sound out words, and exceptions to the
principles.

### A kid's perspective

> What this feels like to me

Children will usually express their frustration and difficulties in a general
way, with statements like "I hate reading!" or "This is stupid!". But if they
could, this is how kids might describe how word decoding and phonics
difficulties affect their reading:

- I just seem to get stuck when I try to read a lot of the words in this
  chapter.
- Figuring out the words takes so much of my energy, I can't even think about
  what it means.
- I don't know how to sound out these words.
- I know my letters and sounds, but I just can't read words on a page.

### A parent's perspective

> What this looks like at home

Here are some clues for parents that a child may have problems with word
decoding and phonics:

- She often gets stuck on words when reading. I end up telling her many of the
  words.
- His reading is very slow because he spends os much time figuring out words.
- She's not able to understand much about what she's read because she's so busy
  trying to sound out the words.
- It's as if he doesn't know how to put the information together to read words.
- Saying "sound it out" to her just seems to make her more frustrated.
- He guesses at words based on the first letter or two; it's as if he doesn't
  pay close attention to the print.

### A teacher's perspective

> What this looks like at school

Here are some clues for teachers that a student may have problems with word
decoding and phonics:

- She has difficulty matching sounds and letters, which can affect reading and
  spelling.
- She decodes in a very labored manner.
- He has trouble reading and spelling phonetically.
- She has a high degree of difficulty with phonics patterns and activities.
- He guesses at words based on the first letter or two.
- Even though I taught several short vowel sounds (or other letter sounds or
  patterns), the corresponding letters are not showing up in his writing
  samples.
- Even though I taught certain letter patterns, she isn't able to recognize them
  when reading words.

## Vocabulary

### What is it?

> Definition

_Vocabulary_ refers to the words we must understand to communicate effectively.
Vocabulary plays a fundamental role in the reading process, and contributes
greatly to a reader's comprehension. A reader cannot understand a text without
knowing what most of the words mean. Students learn the meaning of most words
indirectly, through everyday experiences with language. Other words are learned
through carefully designed instruction.

## A kid's perspective

> What this feels like to me

Children will usually express their frustration and difficulties in a general
way, with statements like "I hate reading!". BIt if they could, this is how kids
might describe their vocabulary difficulties:

- I heard my friend tell what happened in the movie but I didn't really
  understand it.
- I feel like I just use the same words over and over again in my writing.
- I don't like to read on my own because I don't understand lots of the words in
  the book.

## A parent's perspective

> What this looks like at home

Here are some clues that a child may have difficulties as a result of his or her
vocabulary:

- She's unable to tell about her day in a way that makes sense.
- He misuses common words.
- She doesn't link words from a book to similar words from another book or from
  real life.
- He's often not able to find the right word to describe something.

## A teacher's perspective

> What this looks like at school

Here are some clues that a student may have difficulties as a result of his or
her vocabulary:

- She has questions about a lot of word meanings in a grade-appropriate text.
- He seems to have a weak vocabulary.
- She is not able to make connections among words in various texts.
- He's often not able to find the right word to describe something.

## Fluency

### What is it?

> Definition

_Fluency_ is defined as the ability to read with speed, accuracy, and proper
expression. In order to understand what they read, children must be able to read
_fluently_ whether they ar reading aloud or silently. When reading aloud, fluent
readers read in phrases and add intonation appropriately. Their reading is
smooth and has expression. Children who do not read with fluency sound choppy
and awkward. THose students may have difficulty with decoding skills or they may
just need more practice with speed and smoothness in reading.

### A kid's perspective

> What this feels like to me

Children will usually express their frustration and difficulties in a general
way, with statements like "I hate reading!". But if they could, this is how kids
might describe their fluency difficulties:

- I just seem to get stuck when I try to read a lot of the words in this
  chapter.
- It takes me so long to read something.
- Reading through this book takes so much of my energy, I can't even think about
  what it means.

### A parent's perspective

> What this looks like at home

Here are some clues that a child may have problems with fluency:

- He knows how to read words but seems to take a long time to read a short book
  or passage silently.
- She reads a book with no expression; every word and sentence sounds the same.
- He stumbles a lot and loses his place when reading something aloud.
- She reads aloud very slowly.
- He moves his mouth when reading silently (subvocalizing).

### A teacher's perspective

> What this looks like at school

Here are some clues that a student may have problems with fluency:

- Her results on words-correct-per-minute assessments are below grade level or
  targeted benchmark.
- He has difficulty and grows frustrated when reading aloud, either because of
  speed or accuracy.
- She does not read aloud with expression, changing her tone where appropriate.
- He does not "chunk" words into meaningful units.

## Comprehension

### What is it?

> Definition

_Comprehension_ is the understanding and interpretation of what is read. To be
able to accurately understand written material, children need to be able to

1. decode what they read;
2. make connections between what they read and what they already know;
3. think deeply about what they have read.

One big part of comprehension is having sufficient vocabulary, or knowing enough
word meanings. Readers who have strong comprehension are able to draw
conclusions about what they read--what is important, what is a fact, and what
caused an event to happen.

### A kid's perspective

> What this feels like to me

Children will usually express their frustration and difficulties in a general
way, with statements like "I hate reading!". But if they could, this is how kids
might express their comprehension difficulties:

- It takes me so long to read something. It's hard to follow along with
  everything going on.
- I didn't really get what that book was about.
- Why did that character do that? I just don't get it!
- I'm not sure what the most important parts of the book were.
- I couldn't really create an image in my head of what was going on.

### A parent's perspective

> What this looks like at home

Here are some clues that a child may have problems with comprehension:

- She's not able to summarize a passage or a book.
- He might be able to tell you what happened in a story but can't explain why
  events went they way they did.
- She can't explain what a character's thoughts or feelings might have been.
- He doesn't link events in a book to similar events from another book or from
  real life.

### A teacher's perspective

> What this looks like at school

Here are some clues that a student may have problems with comprehension:

- He seems to focus on the "wrong" aspect of a passage; for example, he
  concentrates so much on the details that the main idea is lost.
- She can tell the outcome of a story, but cannot explain why things turned out
  that way.
- He seems to have a weak vocabulary.
- She cannot tell the clear, logical sequence of events in a story.
- He does not pick out the key facts from informational text.
